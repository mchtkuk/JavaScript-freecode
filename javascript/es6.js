//Compare Scopes of the var and let Keywords
//If you are unfamiliar with let, check out this challenge about the difference between let and var.

//When you declare a variable with the var keyword, it is declared globally, or locally if declared inside a function.

//The let keyword behaves similarly, but with some extra features. When you declare a variable with the let keyword inside a block, statement, or expression, its scope is limited to that block, statement, or expression.

//For example:

var numArray = [];
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  numArray.push(i);
}
console.log(numArray);
console.log(i);
//Here the console will display the values [0, 1, 2] and 3.

//With the var keyword, i is declared globally. So when i++ is executed, it updates the global variable. This code is similar to the following:

var numArray = [];
var i;
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  numArray.push(i);
}
console.log(numArray);
console.log(i);
//Here the console will display the values [0, 1, 2] and 3.

//This behavior will cause problems if you were to create a function and store it for later use inside a for loop that uses the i variable. This is because the stored function will always refer to the value of the updated global i variable.

var printNumTwo;
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  if (i === 2) {
    printNumTwo = function() {
      return i;
    };
  }
}
console.log(printNumTwo());
//Here the console will display the value 3.

//As you can see, printNumTwo() prints 3 and not 2. This is because the value assigned to i was updated and the printNumTwo() returns the global i and not the value i had when the function was created in the for loop. The let keyword does not follow this behavior:

let printNumTwo;
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  if (i === 2) {
    printNumTwo = function() {
      return i;
    };
  }
}
console.log(printNumTwo());
console.log(i);
//Here the console will display the value 2, and an error that i is not defined.

//i is not defined because it was not declared in the global scope. It is only declared within the for loop statement. printNumTwo() returned the correct value because three different i variables with unique values (0, 1, and 2) were created by the let keyword within the loop statement.

//Fix the code so that i declared in the if statement is a separate variable than i declared in the first line of the function. Be certain not to use the var keyword anywhere in your code.

//This exercise is designed to illustrate the difference between how var and let keywords assign scope to the declared variable. When programming a function similar to the one used in this exercise, it is often better to use different variable names to avoid confusion.
function checkScope() {
    let i = 'function scope';
    if (true) {
      let i = 'block scope';
      console.log('Block scope i is: ', i);
    }
    console.log('Function scope i is: ', i);
    return i;
  }
  
  
  console.log(checkScope())

//Block scope i is:  block scope
//Function scope i is:  function scope
//function scope

//Mutate an Array Declared with const
//If you are unfamiliar with const, check out this challenge about the const keyword.

//The const declaration has many use cases in modern JavaScript.

//Some developers prefer to assign all their variables using const by default, unless they know they will need to reassign the value. Only in that case, they use let.

//However, it is important to understand that objects (including arrays and functions) assigned to a variable using const are still mutable. Using the const declaration only prevents reassignment of the variable identifier.

const s = [5, 6, 7];
s = [1, 2, 3];
s[2] = 45;
console.log(s);
//s = [1, 2, 3] will result in an error. The console.log will display the value [5, 6, 45].

//As you can see, you can mutate the object [5, 6, 7] itself and the variable s will still point to the altered array [5, 6, 45]. Like all arrays, the array elements in s are mutable, but because const was used, you cannot use the variable identifier s to point to a different array using the assignment operator.

//An array is declared as const s = [5, 7, 2]. Change the array to [2, 5, 7] using various element assignments.

const s = [5, 7, 2];
function editInPlace() {
    // Only change code below this line
    s[0] = 2;
    s[1] = 5;
    s[2] = 7;
    // Using s = [2, 5, 7] would be invalid
     return s;
    // Only change code above this line
  }
  console.log(editInPlace());

//  [ 2, 5, 7 ]



//Prevent Object Mutation
//As seen in the previous challenge, const declaration alone doesn't really protect your data from mutation. To ensure your data doesn't change, JavaScript provides a function Object.freeze to prevent data mutation.

//Any attempt at changing the object will be rejected, with an error thrown if the script is running in strict mode.

let obj = {
  name:"FreeCodeCamp",
  review:"Awesome"
};
Object.freeze(obj);
obj.review = "bad";
obj.newProp = "Test";
console.log(obj); 
//The obj.review and obj.newProp assignments will result in errors, because our editor runs in strict mode by default, and the console will display the value { name: "FreeCodeCamp", review: "Awesome" }.

//In this challenge you are going to use Object.freeze to prevent mathematical constants from changing. You need to freeze the MATH_CONSTANTS object so that no one is able to alter the value of PI, add, or delete properties.

function freezeObj() {
    const MATH_CONSTANTS = {
      PI: 3.14
    };
    // Only change code below this line
  
    Object.freeze(MATH_CONSTANTS);
  
    // Only change code above this line
    try {
      MATH_CONSTANTS.PI = 99;
    } catch(ex) {
      console.log(ex);
    }
    return MATH_CONSTANTS.PI;
  }
  const PI = freezeObj();
