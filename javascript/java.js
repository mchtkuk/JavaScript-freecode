  // Global Scope and Functions
 // In JavaScript, scope refers to the visibility of variables. Variables which are defined outside of a function block have Global scope. This means, they can be seen everywhere in your JavaScript code.
  
 // Variables which are declared without the let or const keywords are automatically created in the global scope. This can create unintended consequences elsewhere in your code or when running a function again. You should always declare your variables with let or const.
  
  

  // Declare the myGlobal variable below this line
const myGlobal = 10;

function fun1() {
  // Assign 5 to oopsGlobal Here
  oopsGlobal = 5;
}

// Only change code above this line

function  fun2() {
  var output = "";
  if (typeof myGlobal != "undefined") {
    output += "myGlobal: " + myGlobal;
  }
  if (typeof oopsGlobal != "undefined") {
    output += " oopsGlobal: " + oopsGlobal;
  }
  console.log(output);
}



//Local Scope and Functions
//Variables which are declared within a function, as well as the function parameters, have local scope. That means they are only visible within that function.
//Here is a function myTest with a local variable called loc.

function myTest() {
  const loc = "foo";
  console.log(loc);
}

myTest();
console.log(loc);

//The myTest() function call will display the string foo in the console. The console.log(loc) line (outside of the myTest function) will throw an error, as loc is not defined outside of the function.

//The editor has two console.logs to help you see what is happening. Check the console as you code to see how it changes. Declare a local variable myVar inside myLocalScope and run the tests.

//Note: The console will still display ReferenceError: myVar is not defined, but this will not cause the tests to fail.


//Understanding Undefined Value returned from a Function
//A function can include the return statement but it does not have to. In the case that the function doesn't have a return statement, when you call it, the function processes the inner code but the returned value is undefined.

Example

let sum = 0;

function addSum(num) {
  sum = sum + num;
}

addSum(3);

//addSum is a function without a return statement. The function will change the global sum variable but the returned value of the function is undefined.

//Create a function addFive without any arguments. This function adds 5 to the sum variable, but its returned value is undefined.


//Assignment with a Returned Value
//If you'll recall from our discussion about Storing Values with the Assignment Operator, everything to the right of the equal sign is resolved before the value is assigned. This means we can take the return value of a function and assign it to a variable.

//Assume we have pre-defined a function sum which adds two numbers together, then:
ourSum = sum(5, 12);
//will call the sum function, which returns a value of 17 and assigns it to the ourSum variable.

//Call the processArg function with an argument of 7 and assign its return value to the variable processed.

// Setup
let processed = 0;

function processArg(num) {
  return (num + 3) / 5;
}

// Only change code below this line

processed = processArg(7);

// output will be 2

//if statements are used to make decisions in code. The keyword if tells JavaScript to execute the code in the curly braces under certain conditions, defined in the parentheses. These conditions are known as Boolean conditions and they may only be true or false.

//When the condition evaluates to true, the program executes the statement inside the curly braces. When the Boolean condition evaluates to false, the statement inside the curly braces will not execute.

//Pseudocode

// if (x true) {statement is executed}
Example

function test (myCondition) {
  if (myCondition) {
    return "It was true";
  }
  return "It was false";
}

test(true);
test(false);
test(true) //returns the string It was true, and test(false) returns the string It was false.

//When test is called with a value of true, the if statement evaluates myCondition to see if it is true or not. Since it is true, the function returns It was true. When we call test with a value of false, myCondition is not true and the statement in the curly braces is not executed and the function returns It was false.


//Sometimes you will need to test more than one thing at a time. The logical and operator (&&) returns true if and only if the operands to the left and right of it are true.

//The same effect could be achieved by nesting an if statement inside another if:

if (num > 5) {
  if (num < 10) {
    return "Yes";
  }
}
return "No";
//will only return Yes if num is greater than 5 and less than 10. The same logic can be written as:
if (num > 5 && num < 10) {
  return "Yes";
}
return "No";
//Replace the two if statements with one statement, using the && operator, which will return the string Yes if val is less than or equal to 50 and greater than or equal to 25. Otherwise, will return the string No.


//The logical or operator (||) returns true if either of the operands is true. Otherwise, it returns false.

//The logical or operator is composed of two pipe symbols: (||). This can typically be found between your Backspace and Enter keys.

//The pattern below should look familiar from prior waypoints:

if (num > 10) {
  return "No";
}
if (num < 5) {
  return "No";
}
return "Yes";
//will return Yes only if num is between 5 and 10 (5 and 10 included). The same logic can be written as:

if (num > 10 || num < 5) {
  return "No";
}
return "Yes";
//Combine the two if statements into one statement which returns the string Outside if val is not between 10 and 20, inclusive. Otherwise, return the string Inside.

function testLogicalOr(val) {
  // Only change code below this line

  if (val > 20 || val < 10) {
    return "Outside";
  }

  // Only change code above this line
  return "Inside";
}

testLogicalOr(15);


//When a condition for an if statement is true, the block of code following it is executed. What about when that condition is false? Normally nothing would happen. With an else statement, an alternate block of code can be executed.

if (num > 10) {
  return "Bigger than 10";
} else {
  return "10 or Less";
}

//Combine the if statements into a single if/else statement.


function testElse(val) {
  let result = "";
if (val > 5) {
  result = "Bigger than 5";
}
  else {
    result = "5 or Smaller"
  }

  return result;
}

testElse(4);

//If you have multiple conditions that need to be addressed, you can chain if statements together with else if statements.

if (num > 15) {
  return "Bigger than 15";
} else if (num < 5) {
  return "Smaller than 5";
} else {
  return "Between 5 and 15";
}


//Order is important in if, else if statements.
//The function is executed from top to bottom so you will want to be careful of what statement comes first.
//Take these two functions as an example.

//Here's the first:

function foo(x) {
  if (x < 1) {
    return "Less than one";
  } else if (x < 2) {
    return "Less than two";
  } else {
    return "Greater than or equal to two";
  }
}
//And the second just switches the order of the statements:


function bar(x) {
  if (x < 2) {
    return "Less than two";
  } else if (x < 1) {
    return "Less than one";
  } else {
    return "Greater than or equal to two";
  }
}

//While these two functions look nearly identical if we pass a number to both we get different outputs.


bar(0)
foo(0) // will return the string Less than one, and bar(0) will return the string Less than two.


//if/else statements can be chained together for complex logic. Here is pseudocode of multiple chained if / else if statements:

if (condition1) {
  statement1
} else if (condition2) {
  statement2
} else if (condition3) {
  statement3
} else {
  statementN
}

//In the casino game Blackjack, a player can determine whether they have an advantage on the next hand over the house by keeping track of the relative number of high and low cards remaining in the deck. This is called Card Counting.

//Having more high cards remaining in the deck favors the player. Each card is assigned a value according to the table below. When the count is positive, the player should bet high. When the count is zero or negative, the player should bet low.

//Count Change	Cards
//+1	2, 3, 4, 5, 6
//0	7, 8, 9
//-1	10, 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A'
//You will write a card counting function. It will receive a card parameter, which can be a number or a string, and increment or decrement the global count variable according to the card's value (see table). The function will then return a string with the current count and the string Bet if the count is positive, or Hold if the count is zero or negative. The current count and the player's decision (Bet or Hold) should be separated by a single space.

//Example Outputs: -3 Hold or 5 Bet

//Hint
//Do NOT reset count to 0 when value is 7, 8, or 9.
//Do NOT return an array.
//Do NOT include quotes (single or double) in the output.

//You may have heard the term object before.

//Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, you access the data in objects through what are called properties.

//Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way, and can represent real world objects, like a cat.

//Here's a sample cat object:

const cat = {
  "name": "Whiskers",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "enemies": ["Water", "Dogs"]
};
//In this example, all the properties are stored as strings, such as name, legs, and tails. However, you can also use numbers as properties. You can even omit the quotes for single-word string properties, as follows:

const anotherObject = {
  make: "Ford",
  5: "five",
  "model": "focus"
};
//owever, if your object has any non-string properties, JavaScript will automatically typecast them as strings.


//Another use of bracket notation on objects is to access a property which is stored as the value of a variable. This can be very useful for iterating through an object's properties or when accessing a lookup table.

//Here is an example of using a variable to access a property:

const dogs = {
  Fido: "Mutt",
  Hunter: "Doberman",
  Snoopie: "Beagle"
};

const myDog = "Hunter";
const myBreed = dogs[myDog];
console.log(myBreed);

//The string Doberman would be displayed in the console.


// Setup
const testObj = {
  12: "Namath",
  16: "Montana",
  19: "Unitas"
};

// Only change code below this line
const playerNumber = 16;  // Change this line
const player = testObj[playerNumber];   // Change this line

console.log(player);

// the string Montana would be displayed in the console.


//Updating Object Properties
//After you've created a JavaScript object, you can update its properties at any time just like you would update any other variable. You can use either dot or bracket notation to update.

//For example, let's look at ourDog:

const ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};
//Since he's a particularly happy dog, let's change his name to the string Happy Camper. 

//Here's how we update his object's name property: ourDog.name = "Happy Camper"; or ourDog["name"] = "Happy Camper"; Now when we evaluate ourDog.name, instead of getting Camper, we'll get his new name, Happy Camper.


// Setup
const myDogg = {
  "name": "Coder",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["freeCodeCamp Campers"]
};

// Only change code below this line

myDogg.name = "Happy Coder";


//


//Add New Properties to a JavaScript Object
//You can add new properties to existing JavaScript objects the same way you would modify them.

//Here's how we would add a bark property to ourDog:

ourDog.bark = "bow-wow";
or

ourDog["bark"] = "bow-wow";

//

const myDoggg = {
  "name": "Happy Coder",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["freeCodeCamp Campers"]
};

myDoggg.bark = "woof";

//Delete Properties from a JavaScript Object
//We can also delete properties from objects like this:

delete ourDogggg.bark;


// Setup
const myDoggggg = {
  "name": "Happy Coder",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["freeCodeCamp Campers"],
  "bark": "woof"
};

// Only change code below this line

delete myDoggggg.tails;

//


//sing Objects for Lookups
//Objects can be thought of as a key/value storage, like a dictionary. If you have tabular data, you can use an object to lookup values rather than a switch statement or an if/else chain. This is most useful when you know that your input data is limited to a certain range.

//Here is an example of a simple reverse alphabet lookup:

const alpha = {
  1:"Z",
  2:"Y",
  3:"X",
  4:"W",
  24:"C",
  25:"B",
  26:"A"
};

alpha[2];
alpha[24];

const value = 2;
alpha[value];

//alpha[2] is the string Y, alpha[24] is the string C, and alpha[value] is the string Y.


//Convert the switch statement into an object called lookup. Use it to look up val and assign the associated string to the result variable.

// Setup
function phoneticLookup(val) {
  let result = "";

  // Only change code below this line
   var lookup = {
    "alpha": "Adams",
    "bravo": "Boston",
    "charlie": "Chicago",
    "delta": "Denver",
    "echo": "Easy",
    "foxtrot": "Frank",
  };

  result = lookup[val];
  // Only change code above this line
  return result;
}

console.log(phoneticLookup("charlie"));


//

//Testing Objects for Properties
//Sometimes it is useful to check if the property of a given object exists or not. We can use the .hasOwnProperty(propname) method of objects to determine if that object has the given property name. .hasOwnProperty() returns true or false if the property is found or not.

//Example

const myObj = {
  top: "hat",
  bottom: "pants"
};

myObj.hasOwnProperty("top");
myObj.hasOwnProperty("middle");

//The first hasOwnProperty returns true, while the second returns false.

//Accessing Nested Objects
//The sub-properties of objects can be accessed by chaining together the dot or bracket notation.

//Here is a nested object:

const ourStorage = {
  "desk": {
    "drawer": "stapler"
  },
  "cabinet": {
    "top drawer": { 
      "folder1": "a file",
      "folder2": "secrets"
    },
    "bottom drawer": "soda"
  }
};

ourStorage.cabinet["top drawer"].folder2;
ourStorage.desk.drawer;
ourStorage.cabinet["top drawer"].folder2 
//would be the string secrets, and ourStorage.desk.drawer would be the string stapler.

//Access the myStorage object and assign the contents of the glove box property to the gloveBoxContents variable. Use dot notation for all properties where possible, otherwise use bracket notation.

const myStorage = {
  "car": {
    "inside": {
      "glove box": "maps",
      "passenger seat": "crumbs"
     },
    "outside": {
      "trunk": "jack"
    }
  }
};

const gloveBoxContents = myStorage.car.inside["glove box"];

// will display the "maps" value


// Accessing Nested Arrays
// As we have seen in earlier examples, objects can contain both nested objects and nested arrays. Similar to accessing nested objects, array bracket notation can be chained to access nested arrays.

// Here is an example of how to access a nested array:

const ourPets = [
  {
    animalType: "cat",
    names: [
      "Meowzer",
      "Fluffy",
      "Kit-Cat"
    ]
  },
  {
    animalType: "dog",
    names: [
      "Spot",
      "Bowser",
      "Frankie"
    ]
  }
];

ourPets[0].names[1];
ourPets[1].names[0];
ourPets[0].names[1] 
// would be the string Fluffy, and ourPets[1].names[0] would be the string Spot.

// Using dot and bracket notation, set the variable secondTree to the second item in the trees list from the myPlants object.

const myPlants = [
  {
    type: "flowers",
    list: [
      "rose",
      "tulip",
      "dandelion"
    ]
  },
  {
    type: "trees",
    list: [
      "fir",
      "pine",
      "birch"
    ]
  }
];

const secondTree = myPlants[1].list[1];

//
